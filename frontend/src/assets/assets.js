        summary: `<p>A long serving Court worker has been found by Watford Employment Tribunal to have been  subject to disability discrimination by the <b>Secretary of State for Justice</b> and <b>His Majesty’s Court Service (HMCS)</b>.</p><br>The worker, Ms.Findik, had worked as an Administrative Officer since 1998 at Highbury Magistrates Court.<br><br>She was found to be a  hardworking and a loyal member of staff who was not supported by her Managers.<br><br>Ms.Findik suffered with several disabilities, including Misophonia, making her extremely sensitive to noise.<br><br>This required her to work from a quiter private room or office with less noise and interruptions, which HMCS failed to provide quickly enough or as a permanent solution.<br><br>Ms Findik also found it difficult to travel at peak times on public transport  due to her noise sensitivity.<br><br>The Tribunal found there was suitable advice in several OH reports and from Ms.Findik herself, which was not given sufficient ‘attention’ by her Managers.<br><br>The Tribunal ruled this was unreasonable.<br><br>Ms.Findik also suffered from pain because of slipped discs in her neck following an unrelated assault on the tube in 2006.<br><br>This made  it difficult for her to look or bend her head down while sitting at a desk or when working from home without the proper equipment that she needed.<br><br>HMCS was found to have failed to provide several important reasonable adjustments and auxiliary equipment.<br><br>This included <b>a large screen, an ergonomic keyboard and a tilted document holder</b>, which would have reduced Ms.Findik pain and suffering given her disabilities.<br><br>Ms.Findik was given a first written warning for sickness absence and told to improve her attendance performance.<br><br>The Tribunal however ruled this was partly caused by her not having the equipment that she needed and which she had repeatedly requested.<br><br>Managers had discretion under the HMCS Sickness Policy but failed to exercise their discretion not to issue a final warning, despite Ms.Findik also appealing against the warning.<br><br>The Tribunal did find in favour of her employer on several points.<br><br>The Tribunal found that a <b>footrest, ergonomic chair and headset</b> which were also not provided quickly, did not result in any substantial disadvantage.<br><br>The Tribunal ruled that Ms.Findik did not make or take excessive phone calls, so there was no need <b>for a headset</b> to reduce any unfavourable treatment.<br><br>In a remedy judgment this month, the Tribunal ordered the Secretary of State for Justice and HMCS to pay Findik compensation.<br><br>She was awarded a total of <b>£27,508.27</b>, made up of ‘£21,000 for injury to feelings’ and ‘£8,508.27 in interest’, according to a Judgment handed down by Employment Judge Bedeau.<br><br>Full Judgement is <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d18f170e4387ef0d1aeaba/Mrs_H_Findik_-_v_-_Secretary_Of_State_for_Justice_-_3314681-2021_-_Judgment.pdf" style="color:red">here</a>`,

        introSummary: 'A legal secretary at RBG Legal has lost her harassment and disability claims following a three day employment tribunal hearing',
        summary: `<p>A legal secretary at RBG Legal has lost her harassment and disability claims following a three day employment tribunal hearing.</p><br>Ms. Pemberton had rheumatoid arthritis. She also suffered with pain in her hands and swelling of her middle finger caused by typing and repetitive mouse clicking tasks, when using the law firm’s computer equipment and software.<br><br>Ms. Pemberton brought three different discrimination complaints, spanning several years from July 2020 to July 2023.<br><br>The claims included a <b>failure to make reasonable adjustments, harassment and victimisation</b> under the Equality Act 2010.<br><br>A previous claim was brought by her for events prior to July 2020. These were settled, though details of the settlement were not part of the latest hearing.<br><br>The Tribunal were told that Ms. Pemberton worked from home for nearly the entire 3 years she worked for RBG Legal.<br><br>In August 2021, all staff were notified of ‘a return to the office’ and hybrid working arrangements were to be phased in, although Ms. Pemberton was exempted at the time.<br><br>RBG Legal attempted to “explore” with Pemberton, for her to work two days in the office, when her connectivity issues prevented her from working from home.<br><br>Following a workplace assessment and a number of meetings, RBG also provided her with a light-touch keyboard, a footrest and a large monitor in mid-August 2020; as well as installing Dragon software (speech to typing) on her computer.<br><br>Dragon was not compatible with a substantial amount of the work that Ms. Pemberton did, which required her to also use other day to day software as part of her normal duties.<br><br>Despite the software issues, the Tribunal did not find that use of Dragon caused Ms. Pemberton any serious disadvantage as she had no difficulty with her speech.<br><br>After repeated absences, she was later informed by RBG management that having:<br><br><i>“exhausted all adjustments recommended by the occupational health therapist, we will now need to put you on Statutory Sick Pay effective from Monday 24 January 2022”.</i><br><br>On 11 March 2022, Occupational Health suggested obtaining a DWP Access to Work report, which took a number of months to arrange, though this was not the fault of either party.<br><br>On 23 March 2022, RBG invited Pemberton to a formal sickness meeting to discuss her continued absence.<br><br>She replied the next day with a list of 28 questions she wanted RBG to answer before any meeting. The Tribunal found the tone of her emails were ‘somewhat confrontational’.<br><br>She then emailed a further 21 questions over the following week.<br><br>A further 100 questions were sent by Pemberton later in the process.<br><br>RBG answered some of the written questions initially, but continued to try to arrange a meeting to discuss any outstanding issues.<br><br>Pemberton rejected the meeting suggestions, partly because she could not take her own notes at the meetings due to her disabilities.<br><br>Instead, she threatened to start Tribunal proceedings, in the absence of any written response from the firm.<br><br>The Tribunal found that RBG had acted reasonably in the approach they took, responding to some questions and offering a meeting to discuss any remaining issues.<br><br>The Tribunal also found that RBG had adjusted work patterns and duties both for Pemberton and other colleagues to support her.<br><br>Ms Pemberton’s boss had “modified his own working habits” to accommodate her absence and reduced capacity to work, learning to touch-type, undertake some admin tasks himself as well as working longer hours.<br><br>The firm demonstrated they needed on site secretarial support and Ms. Pemberton had not been “required” or ordered to work from the office, the firm were merely exploring the possibility for her to do so, which the Tribunal found to be sensible.<br><br>The Tribunal agreed with the firm’s overall approach, given there were 3 secretaries for 20 fee earners and a degree of on-site support would be required.<br><br>Some of Ms. Pemberton’s discrimination claims were found by the Tribunal to be out of time.<br><br>As the discrimination complaints were not factually made out on the evidence, the Tribunal declined to consider the time issues in any great detail.<br><br>None of Ms. Pemberton’s claims succeeded.`,

        summary: `<p>Female shop workers have won their equal pay battle with high street giant Next.</p><br>The Tribunal ruled in favour of the shop workers in a landmark employment ruling this month.<br><br>Current and former female workers took their employer Next to an Employment Tribunal arguing that they were paid less than their warehouse colleagues, who were mostly men.<br><br>The claim has been fiercely fought with complex assessments about the level of differences involved in the shop and warehouse roles.<br><br>The shop workers argued that their jobs were equally demanding - physically, mentally and in terms of knowledge, responsibilities, skills and decision making. <br><br>The Tribunal decided that Next’s pay was discriminatory against the claimants. More than 3500 female workers are now in line for payouts running to thousands of pounds each for back pay, and increases in future pay. Nearly 80% of Next staff are women.<br><br>The claim was successfully led by law firm Leigh Day. Their top employment and discrimination barrister, Elizabeth George who works as an employed Counsel for the Law firm, led the claim. Ms. George said:<br><br><i style="color: darkblue;">“When you have female-dominated jobs being paid less than male-dominated jobs and the work is equal, employers cannot pay women less simply by pointing to the market saying – it is going rate for the jobs…”</i><br><br>The reasons given by Next for paying its female shop staff less was that they paid the market rates for warehouse staff. The Tribunal found there was ”no conscious or subconscious discrimination” on their part which affected the basic rates of pay.Instead <i>“The drive and imperative was to reduce cost and enhance profit”.</i><br><br>The claim could cost Next over £30 million in payouts.<br><br>Next said it was their intention to lodge an appeal as ‘it raises a number of important legal points’.<br><br>The appeal means that payouts will be put on hold until the Employment Appeal Tribunal rule on the long running dispute, which has gone on for more than 6 years.<br><br>In a statement, Next also said the Tribunal had rejected a number of claims of direct discrimination and some of the indirect discrimination claims.<br><br>The claim is being closely watched by other high street chains and some large Supermarkets, who also face similar equal pay and sex discrimination claims from female shop staff.<br>Some of these other claims are also being led by Leigh Day.<br><br>The Judgement is likely to be a huge encouragement and prompt further equal pay claims in other sectors, such as care, construction, hospitality and Local Authority/Councils.<br><br>Full Tribunal Judgement is <a href="https://www.nextplc.co.uk/~/media/Files/N/Next-PLC-V2/documents/investors/1302019-2018-Reserved%20Judgment%2022-08-2024.pdf" style="color:red">here</a>`,
