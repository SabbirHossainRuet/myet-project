        summary: `<p>A Manchester Court worker has been successful in her claim for victimisation against the <b>Secretary of State for Justice</b> and <b>His Majesty’s Courts and Tribunal Service (HMCTS).</b></p><br>This is the second Court worker who has successfully sued the Secretary of State for Justice in the last couple of months.<br><br>Last month, another Court worker in London at Highbury Magistrates Court was <b>awarded £27,000 for discrimination.</b><br><br>In the latest case, following a hearing at the Manchester Employment Tribunal, Ms. B successfully argued that she was victimised in breach of the Equality Act 2010.<br><br>The victimisation took place in February 2022, although there were other employment issues going back to at least 2019, which were raised as part of the claim.<br><br>Ms. B complained about the conduct of a Team Leader at <b>Manchester Magistrates Court</b>, where she worked as a listing clerk.<br><br>Ms. B had been employed by HMCTS since 2008. She was a long serving worker who had contributed to very positive work in the North West area according to her employer.<br><br>The row centred on a complaint Ms. B made that the Team Leader was breaching covid regulations by giving ‘in person training’ to a newly appointed female court worker, which was not normal practice at the time.<br><br>Ms. B having raised her concerns about the ‘face to face’ training, lodged a grievance in November 2021.<br><br>The Team Leader (Mr. O’Bryan) later made a counter grievance, where according to the Tribunal he told ‘untruths’ about Ms. B.<br><br>He claimed to management that Ms. B had said that he was ‘all over’ the female colleague he was training. This was found by the Tribunal to be untruthful.<br><br>Ms. B continued to work for a period, as she told the Tribunal she tried to carry on with her work, despite the hostility and victimisation she faced.<br><br>She went off on long term sickness absence from September 2022, after finding it too difficult to continue.<br><br>According to the Tribunal, the employer regarded Ms. B as a valuable and well respected employee, playing a key role in the North West Region’s Equality Group.<br><br>The Tribunal referred to a letter from the Chief Executive of HMCTS, Mr. Goodwin, who said:<br><br><ul style="list-style-type:none"><li><b><i>Chief Executive of HMCTS, Mr Goodwin, at page 106 of the remedy bundle in a letter of 16 June 2023 to the Mayor of Greater Manchester.

        summary: `<p>Tesco Stores Ltd (‘Tesco’) has lost a controversial practice of <b>‘fire and rehire’</b> after a battle with a retail and distribution trade Union and their members.</p><br>The Supreme Court, overturning an earlier appeal that Tesco had won, came down on the side of USDAW union and its members in legal arguments about the contractual terms at the centre of the row which started in 2021.<br><br>Tesco wanted to fire a small number of employees, and rehire them on lower pay.<br><br>The workers argued this was unfair as Tesco had made an earlier ‘permanent’ benefits agreement to honour their contractual terms.<br><br>In 2007, Tesco wanted to close some distribution centres and open new ones, and agreed to pay workers an element of <b>‘retained pay’</b> so they would relocate.<br><br>In 2021 however, Tesco sought to abolish the ‘retained pay’ which affected approximately 50 people working at distribution centres in Daventry and Lichfield.<br><br>In 2022, USDAW successfully applied for an injunction to stop Tesco going ahead with its plan. Tesco overturned the injunction on appeal in the same year.<br><br>Last week on Thursday, the <b>Supreme Court</b> reversed the appeal decision.<br><br>The five justices ruled that when Tesco offered and agreed the retained pay deal in the beginning, it did so on a ‘permanent basis’, and it was not up to Tesco to now unilaterally undo the contract.<br><br>The Supreme Court ruled, using the word ‘permanent’ did not indicate that the deal was time limited.<br><br>The Court said:<br><br><ul style="list-style-type:none"><li>“The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal and restores the injunction granted by Ellenbogen J. The employment contracts contained a term implied by fact with the effect that the employer’s right to terminate could not be exercised for the purpose of depriving the employees of their right to RP. Lord Burrows and Lady Simler give the leading judgment, with which Lord Lloyd-Jones agrees. Lord Leggatt and Lord Reed give concurring judgments.</li></ul><br><b>Neil Todd, a partner at law firm Thompsons Solicitors, which represented Usdaw, says:</b><br><br><ul style="list-style-type:none"><li>“This is a fantastic judgement for Usdaw and the members concerned. Those in receipt of retained pay were promised unequivocally that they would be afforded a permanent benefit under their employment contract if they agreed to remain with the business and support it when it needed them most.</li><br><li>“They were then threatened with ‘fire and rehire’ when Tesco considered that the benefit had served its purpose. This decision illustrates that a court will intervene to give effect to the parties’ intentions when entering into a contract. It also demonstrates that a right to an injunction is available regarding a breach of contract of employment when damages are not an adequate remedy, as was the case here.</li><br><li>“The injunction will prevent this important right from being stripped away. The litigation has been hard fought, but we are delighted to achieve an outcome that we consider just in all circumstances.”</li></ul><br>Tesco said the majority of distribution colleagues do not receive this top up pay, and instead wanted to make a ‘competitive’ lump sum offer to abolish it or their contracts would be terminated, and reoffered on the same terms without the ‘retained pay’ entitlement.<br><br>It added , its distribution colleagues <b>‘play a really critical role’</b> in helping to serve its customers, and all the workers were highly valued and respected.<br><br>The new government has proposed to abolish the controversial policy of ‘fire and rehire’ after a number of large employers have used the tactic over recent years. In X P&O, sacked over 800 workers and sough to rehire them via an agency.<br><br>Full judgment is <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2022-0133.html" style="color:red">here</a>`,

        summary: `<p>An employment lawyer who claimed a range of unlawful acts - race discrimination, unfair dismissal, wrongful dismissal, unfair constructive dismissal, providing an unsafe place to work, personal injury and victimisation against his former employer - has lost all his claims against the firm.</p><br>Mr. D who worked for RBL Law Ltd, now RBG Holdings, claimed that he was subject to race discrimination and other unfair acts.<br><br>He claimed, a racist comment was made by the former CEO of the firm (Respondent two in the proceedings) at a public dinner in 2018, which was organised to celebrate the firm’s London Stock Exchange Listing.<br><br>The CEO later apologised for using the racist phrase.  She was dismissed from the firm in early 2023, after 6 years in post. There was no suggestion it was anything to do with Mr. D’s claim.<br><br>In front of a large crowd, the former CEO made what were alleged to be racist comments, which were also made in front of the firm’s founder and senior partner Ian Roseblatt.<br><br>The firm admitted the highly offensive comments were made but denied all the claims.<br><br>Instead they claimed that the claimant was dismissed for a fair reason related to his capability.<br><br>Mr.D started work for the firm in May 2017 and was dismissed in February 2020.<br><br><b>Earlier Proceedings 2020-2023</b><br><br>Mr.D made an application for <b>Interim Relief</b> in 2020 for the firm to continue to pay him or to honour his contract until his full case was decided, but the application was dismissed.<br><br>The Respondents attempted to <b>strike out</b> the claims on the basis the claim had not been ‘actively pursued’ due to no contact over a 28 month period from June 2020-October 2022, and for ‘unreasonable conduct’.<br><br>That application failed and was dismissed in January 2023 following a preliminary hearing.<br><br>The Tribunal ruled any delay was due to Covid lockdowns and the Claimant simply waited for the Tribunal to progress his claim, rather than chasing the Tribunal for a response.<br><br>In relation to unreasonable conduct, there was a further delay in 2021/2022, which the Tribunal did find the Claimant to have acted unreasonably, but only to a limited extent, and not enough for the claim to be struck out. The ET stated:<br><br><ul style="list-style-type:none"><li><b><i>“However I did not accept that the delay was such as gave rise to a substantial risk that it was not possible to have a fair trial of the issues in the action, or was likely to cause or to have caused serious prejudice to the defendants”.</i></b></li><li>(Para 43 , Jan 23 Judgment)</li></ul><br>The Tribunal ruled that there was no serious risk to memories fading for the Respondent’s witnesses and therefore little risk that a fair trial was no longer possible.<br><br>Mr. D had set out a very detailed claim form, provided detailed further and better particulars at the request of the Respondents and there had been disclosure of documents.<br><br>The Tribunal also observed, witnesses statements were taken by the Respondent for the earlier Interim Relief application.<br><br>The Tribunal determined that the Respondents were therefore in an unusually good position to defend the claim, as evidence had been obtained very early on.<br><br>Employment Judge Brown also stated:<br><br><ul style="list-style-type:none"><li><b><i>“The Respondents’ failure to make financial provision for the hearing was the Respondents’ decision.</i></b></li><br><li><b><i> I did not find that the fact that individual Respondents would face proceedings persuasive towards striking out the claim.

It would not be proportionate simply to strike it out”.</i></b></li></ul><br>The Tribunal also refused to allow the Claimant to amend a number of his claims, though some minor amendments were allowed.<br><br><b>Later Proceedings in 2024</b><br><br>After a 4 year legal battle and the full hearing of the claim at the central London Employment Tribunal (ET) in Holborn, the ET found that all the claims should be dismissed.<br><br>Although the Tribunal agreed that the claim for the racist comment was well founded, it was out of time and therefore dismissed.<br><br>No extension of time was granted as Mr. D was well aware of the time limits, given his professional role as an employment lawyer and head of the employment department.<br><br>The Tribunal went further to state:<br><br><ul style="list-style-type:none"><li><i>‘…he has only sought to revive it in order to cause maximum embarrassment to the respondents’.</i></li></ul><br>The Tribunal also found that the founding partner did not laugh at the racist comment as alleged, but instead was himself offended by the term and admonished the former CEO for what she had said.<br><br>The Tribunal also found the former CEO <b>did not use the term</b> as a way to violate the claimant’s <b>dignity or of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.</b><br><br>The Tribunal did find that it created an offensive environment for the Claimant, albeit fleetingly.<br><br>Other attendees were equally offended, though the Tribunal did recognise that due to the Mr. D’s heritage he had a unique personal connection to the phrase that was used.<br><br>All of the claims failed.<br><br>A spokesperson for the firm said<br><br><ul style="list-style-type:none"><li><b><i>‘We are pleased the tribunal unanimously dismissed each and every claim made..’.</i></b></li></ul>Mr. D represented himself at the hearing.`,

        introSummary: 'Female shop workers have won their equal pay battle with high street giant Next. The Tribunal ruled in favour of the shop workers in a landmark employment ruling this month.',
        summary: `<p>Female shop workers have won their equal pay battle with high street giant Next.</p><br>The Tribunal ruled in favour of the shop workers in a landmark employment ruling this month.<br><br>Current and former female workers took their employer Next to an Employment Tribunal arguing that they were paid less than their warehouse colleagues, who were mostly men.<br><br>The claim has been fiercely fought with complex assessments about the level of differences involved in the shop and warehouse roles.<br><br>The shop workers argued that their jobs were equally demanding - physically, mentally and in terms of knowledge, responsibilities, skills and decision making. <br><br>The Tribunal decided that Next’s pay was discriminatory against the claimants. More than 3500 female workers are now in line for payouts running to thousands of pounds each for back pay, and increases in future pay. Nearly 80% of Next staff are women.<br><br>The claim was successfully led by law firm Leigh Day. Their top employment and discrimination barrister, Elizabeth George who works as an employed Counsel for the Law firm, led the claim. Ms. George said:<br><br><i style="color: darkblue;">“When you have female-dominated jobs being paid less than male-dominated jobs and the work is equal, employers cannot pay women less simply by pointing to the market saying – it is going rate for the jobs…”</i><br><br>The reasons given by Next for paying its female shop staff less was that they paid the market rates for warehouse staff. The Tribunal found there was ”no conscious or subconscious discrimination” on their part which affected the basic rates of pay.Instead <i>“The drive and imperative was to reduce cost and enhance profit”.</i><br><br>The claim could cost Next over £30 million in payouts.<br><br>Next said it was their intention to lodge an appeal as ‘it raises a number of important legal points’.<br><br>The appeal means that payouts will be put on hold until the Employment Appeal Tribunal rule on the long running dispute, which has gone on for more than 6 years.<br><br>In a statement, Next also said the Tribunal had rejected a number of claims of direct discrimination and some of the indirect discrimination claims.<br><br>The claim is being closely watched by other high street chains and some large Supermarkets, who also face similar equal pay and sex discrimination claims from female shop staff.<br>Some of these other claims are also being led by Leigh Day.<br><br>The Judgement is likely to be a huge encouragement and prompt further equal pay claims in other sectors, such as care, construction, hospitality and Local Authority/Councils.<br><br>Full Tribunal Judgement is <a href="https://www.nextplc.co.uk/~/media/Files/N/Next-PLC-V2/documents/investors/1302019-2018-Reserved%20Judgment%2022-08-2024.pdf" style="color:red">here</a>`,
